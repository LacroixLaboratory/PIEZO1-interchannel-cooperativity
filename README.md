# PIEZO1-interchannel-cooperativity
The first MATLAB code is used to simulate a system containing a variable number of ion channels that open and close stochastically and independently from each other. The open probability, mean open dwell time and variance can be set by the user.
The second code is used to extract discrete opening events duration from raw ionic current traces from patches containing more than 8 channels (the commercial Clampex software has a maximal limit of 8).
